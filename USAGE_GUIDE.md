## Understanding the Analysis

### Local Trend Lines

**What they are:**
- Short-term support and resistance based on recent price action
- Calculated using moving averages and peak detection

**How to interpret:**
- **Local Resistance** (upper line): Price may struggle to break above
- **Local Support** (lower line): Price may find buying pressure

**Trading implications:**
- Consider selling near local resistance
- Consider buying near local support
- Breakouts above/below indicate trend changes

### Global Trend Lines

**What they are:**
- Major trend lines spanning the entire dataset
- Identified by scoring all possible peak combinations

**How to interpret:**
- **Global Resistance**: Long-term ceiling, strong selling pressure
- **Global Support**: Long-term floor, strong buying pressure

**Trading implications:**
- Breaking global resistance = strong bullish signal
- Breaking global support = strong bearish signal
- Respect these levels for position sizing

### Psychological Levels

**What they are:**
- Price zones where the market has repeatedly interacted
- Often round numbers or historically significant prices

**How to interpret:**
- High touch count = strong psychological significance
- Price tends to pause or reverse at these levels

**Trading implications:**
- Set take-profit orders near psychological levels
- Watch for breakout confirmations
- Use as reference points for stop-losses
